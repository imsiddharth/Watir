# Watir

This purpose of this project is to get basic understanding of watir-webdriver.
It gives the perfect example how the BDD works with Page Object Model.

BDD can be compared with CUCUMBER feature files which is under feature directory.

The project required some gems.

rspec
watir-webdriver
cucumber
rake

The gems can be installed using command " gem install gem_name ".
gems can also be installed using bundler.

Thanks,
Siddharth
